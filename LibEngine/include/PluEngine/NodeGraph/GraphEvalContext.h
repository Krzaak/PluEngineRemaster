	// Polymorphic on purpose: the data-pin contract on GraphNode takes this base, so a node that needs
	// its domain's extras downcasts (dynamic_cast) instead of every graph domain re-declaring the
	// contract. A node that only computes values (math/logic/vector) never needs the downcast and
	// therefore works in every graph domain unchanged.
