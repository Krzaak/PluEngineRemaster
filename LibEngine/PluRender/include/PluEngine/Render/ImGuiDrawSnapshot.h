    // Deep copy of one ImGui frame, handed from the Main thread (which builds the
    // UI) to the Render thread (which owns the GL context and submits
    // ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_RenderDrawData) through a TripleBuffer - same handoff
    // pattern as RenderSnapshot.
    //
    // Why a deep copy is required:
    //  - ImDrawData::CmdLists point to ImDrawList objects owned by ImGuiContext and
    //    recycled on the next ImGui::NewFrame(). The render thread reads with up to
    //    one frame of latency, so the lists must be cloned (ImDrawList::CloneOutput).
    //  - ImDrawData::Textures points to ImGui::GetPlatformIO().Textures, a vector
    //    the main thread rebuilds every frame in UpdateTexturesEndFrame()
    //    (resize(0) + repopulate). Reading that vector from the render thread would
    //    race on its storage, so we copy the pointer list into snapshot-owned
    //    memory. The ImTextureData objects themselves are stable for the program
    //    lifetime; with a static font atlas they reach ImTextureStatus_OK after the
    //    first upload and are no longer mutated by either side.
